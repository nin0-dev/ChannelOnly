# ChannelOnly
Telegram bot dedicated to restricting groups linked to channels to comments.

basically, on Telegram, to make channel comments, you need to link a group. and you may want for that group to be **only** used for channel messages comments. this is where ChannelOnly comes in. add it as an admin, and it automatically removes any message that are not from channel comments.
